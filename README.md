# constructor-word-guess

Game Instructions:

If so, they simply start guessing letters to complete a word. They have 10 chances to guess the correct word.
Once they either guess the correct word or run out of guesses, they have a chance to play again or quit.

Letter.js: This constructor displays an underscore as a placeholder for missing letters.
